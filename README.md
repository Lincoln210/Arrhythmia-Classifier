# Arrhythmia Detection and Classification
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect and classify arrhythmias using continuous ECG data. The goal is to improve early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases by providing a scalable and automated detection system that addresses the limitations of traditional ECG tests, which often miss arrhythmias due to short monitoring periods.

## Features
Automated Detection: The model continuously monitors ECG data to detect and classify arrhythmias, reducing the reliance on manual symptom reporting.
Scalability: The system is designed to be scalable, allowing it to handle large datasets and be deployed in real-world healthcare settings.
Early Diagnosis: By detecting arrhythmias early, the system can help in timely medical intervention, potentially saving lives.

## Dataset
The project uses the Chapman University ECG dataset, which contains a variety of ECG recordings with labeled arrhythmias.

## Technologies Used
**Python:** The primary programming language used for development.\
**NumPy & Pandas:** Used for data processing and manipulation.\
**Scikit-learn:** Used for building and training the machine learning models.\
**Google Colab:** Utilized as the development environment.
